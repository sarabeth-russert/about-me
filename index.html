      <p class="textbody">Hi, my name is Sara Russert and I am a 201 student at Code Fellows. This is my second course with <abbr title="Code Fellows">CF</abbr> and I am excited to go all the way through 401. I currently plan on taking Javascript as my 401 but I am still considering other languages.</p>
      <p class="textbody">I grew up in Renton, Washington and went through my pre-college education there. I did the running start program in high school, attending <a href="https://www.greenriver.edu/"> Green River College</a> starting my junior year. I commplete my Associate in Arts degree shortly after graduating high school and then promptly quit formal education.</p>
      <p class="textbody">During my early 20's I performed as a vocalist in a few punk/hardcore bands and toured for several years working in jobs that allowed me to travel frequently for weeks at a time. Including as a Dog Trainer, Barista, Baker, Cafe Server, and Exotic Animal Care Specialist.</p>
      <p class="textbody">In my late 20's I stopped touring and started working as a production baker for an organic vegan donut shop, <a href="https://www.mightyo.com/">Mighty-O Donuts</a>. I moved through the ranks as a baker, lead, manager, and eventually an admin heavy role maintaining social media on top of general retail production management. While I was employed by Mighty-O I was selected to participate on Food Network Challenge where I built a giant elephant sculpture out of donuts and made an assortment of great tasting donuts to be judged. I won against three other donut shops and recieved a prize of $10,000.</p>
      <p class="textbody">My Food Network win allowed me to leave the bakery and start my own business teaching cooking classes and doing small personal chef gigs and party catering. Eventually that melded with my passion for fitness and I began teaching health focused food and fitness classes and then went on to coach stength and fitness full time. During my career as a Personal Trainer I have won several Natural Bodybuilding and Powerlifting events in my weight class.</p>
      <p class="textbody">I am now transitioning to a new career as a software developer and am super excited to get to solve puzzles and use my brain in different ways. I love to make things and can't wait to use creative thinking to make beautiful code. I hope to someday work for Disney as an Imagineer, someone who designs for the parks, so I can use technology to create magical experiences for children of all ages.</p>
